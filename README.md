<h1>Mobileye Project- Traffic Light Detection</h1>
Detecting traffic lights in image and calculate their distance using image processing and machine learning with Matplotlib, TensorFlow and Karas libraries.<br>
The project includes: <br>Detect light sources candidates.<br>Calculate candidate probability and decide if it is a traffic light using neural net <br>
Find the distance of the traffic lights in the image.<br>
The project was made based on cityscape dataset.
